# AT-AWP
This is an unofficial TensorFlow implementation of the vanilla Adversarial Weight Perturbation (AT-AWP) training proposed by [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05884). The code is written to tackle a tabular dataset in the form of shapelets (shape=(wxhx1) per label), however it needs minor altering in order to use for any deep learning task (either NLP or CV).
